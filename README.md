- 👋 Hi, I’m @WitteDuivel
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things though, some of them being coding and physics. These are two of my favorite ones
- 🌱 I’m currently learning well in coding, I am learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing to be honest, I mostly like to work alone
- 📫 How to reach me, no way!!!
